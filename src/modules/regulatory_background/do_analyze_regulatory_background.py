Your task:
- Read and analyze all uploaded FDA meeting minutes in PDF form.
- Extract and evaluate FDA's responses to the sponsor's questions.
- Identify whether the sponsorâ€™s strategy aligns with FDA feedback.
- For each of the following categories:
  - Predicate device reference
  - Intended use
  - Clinical trial requirements
  - Risk classification
  - Regulatory submission history

Return a JSON object matching this structure:
- Each field should include:
  - title: A short summary of the topic
  - content: Extracted text from the FDA meeting minutes
  - suggestion: Any concerns, gaps, or follow-up actions suggested by FDA

Only include keys present in the schema. If a topic is not discussed, say "Not discussed in meeting" in all three fields.
